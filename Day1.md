# Day 1
So I spent the first 'day' of 100 days of code just throwing together various templates on vercel..

I was able to get the 'template' imported for sapper onto [vercel](vercel.com) - I was able to buy a domainname from [GoDaddy](Godaddy.com) (disclosure, I'm an employee) and just edit the main `src\index.svelte` pages to remove the starter images and put some basic info down. if you're like me and trying to learn more svelte, you can't go wrong following [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris) on twitter - as one of the founders/core team of svelte, he's always fun and there's also other accounts like [Svelte Society](https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety) that regularly showcase great projects, to help with inspiration and help motivate you on your own 100 days of code journey.
