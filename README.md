# 100daysofcode README.md
Placing some notes here for my 100daysofcode excercises

## Tools
for this notetaking, I'm mostly using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Github](github.com) - I'm just making a new repository and just naming each file `Day#.md` and using visual studio's VERY helpful markdown editor/preview.

There are a ton of cool tools out there that are a bit more... complex than what I'm looking for currently.
1. [FOAM - the visual studio code plugin / ecosystem for note taking](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) while it's very cool I dont' really need the 'graph' I might come back to it later, having things linked to other things is great, really.
   |Pros|Cons|
   |----|----|
   | Free! | not a huge team, less polish than others |
   | Open source! | links may need a bit of work, show graph doesn't update instantly, minor things |
   | builds on power of visual studio code |  |
2. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) not a visual studio code plugin / system, but a nice polished standalone app - has fun features like backlinks
   |Pros|Cons|
   |----|----|
   | Basic is free | larger things like publishing and team collab are paid features? |
   | very polished and nice | not certain why you'd pay for a fancy markdown previewer when vscode is right here? |
